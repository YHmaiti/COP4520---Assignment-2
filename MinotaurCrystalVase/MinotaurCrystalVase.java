 * @strategy: For this problem I have used the second strategy that consists on the following:
            * The Minotaurâ€™s second strategy allowed the guests to place a sign on the door
            * indicating when the showroom is available. The sign would read AVAILABLE or
            * BUSY. Every guest is responsible to set the sign to BUSY when entering the
            * showroom and back to AVAILABLE upon exit. That way guests would not bother trying
            * to go to the showroom if it is not available.
 *
 * @note: discussion and more explanation is on the ReadMe file
 * @note: also in the process a guest can visit several times, but no need to a manually made randomization, we let the master thread do it
 *        when running child threads.
