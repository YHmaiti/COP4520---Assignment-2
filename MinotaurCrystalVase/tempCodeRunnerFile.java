            * The Minotaurâ€™s second strategy allowed the guests to place a sign on the door
            * indicating when the showroom is available. The sign would read AVAILABLE or
            * BUSY. Every guest is responsible to set the sign to BUSY when entering the
            * showroom and back to AVAILABLE upon exit. That way guests would not bother trying
            * to go to the showroom if it is not available.
