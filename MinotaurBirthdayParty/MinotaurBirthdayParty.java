 * @brief: This program simulates a labyrinth based birthday party that is for a Minotaur and some guests.
 *         The guests access the labyrinth in a random order, however, the guests should report to the minotaur when 
 *         every guest present went through it. The minotaur placed a cake at the end of the labyrinth near the exit and 
 *         refilling the cake is possible whenever requested. The minotaur can pick any guests to go into the labyrinth, even 
 *         pick the same guest several times. The guests need to plan a strategy to inform the minotaur that all the guests
 *         entred the labyrinth at least 1 time. We know that a birthday cake is present at the exit of the labyrinth at the start of the 
 *         simulation.   
 * 
 * @MyStrategy: I use a random number generator to chose a random guest that will act as a decider, meaning that they will be the only guest that will 
 *             request a cupcake from the Minotaur whenever they see that it is not there, they will also keep track of the count of the number of guests that 
 *             went into the labyrinth and let the Minotaur know at the end that everyone went through the labyrinth at least 1 time. I was inspired to follow this strategy
 *             based on the prisoners examples we discussed in class. 
 *             Now, if a guest goes in and they see the cake, and they did not eat before, they can eat it once. No guest 
 *             will eat more than once, thus, if they already ate, next time they go through and they find a cake, they will not touch it. If a guest that is not the chosen decider,
 *             goes in and doesn't find a cake they will simply leave without requesting a cupcake. If the decider goes in and doesn't find a cake, they are the only guest that can request one, and increment the 
 *             count of the guests at each time they request a cake. When the decider reaches a count of n - 1 that means that everyone went through the labyrinth at least 1 time.
 * 
 * @note: testing and additional clarifications are in the ReadMe file as needed.
 * 
 * @note: since he decider guest is the first to go in, they will eat the cake if it's there, and then follow the same rule as other guests, if you ate once, don't eat again.
